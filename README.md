# advent-of-code-2020-golang
Advent of Code is an event held in December on adventofcode.com where problems are released on midnight for the first 25 days of December.
I am using Go as the language to solve the problems. This repository contains the code for my solution to each days puzzle.
I am using Advent of Code as a way to introduce myself to Go and learn more about the langauge.
